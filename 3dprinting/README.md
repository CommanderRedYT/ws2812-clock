# 3D Printing Files

The models are created using Fusion 360.

## Printing

I recommend printing with the hexagon infill pattern as it will look really cool when the clock is on!

## Notes
- As of now, the model is kind of cut in the middle so it can be printed on the Prusa printers.
- Also, some case-features are not fully working yet.

## Known problems
- Buttons not working --> Make them cylinders that can slide up and down instead of making it print-in-place and "bendable"
